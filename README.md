<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![gif of site 1](public/img_heimdall.png)

This Rails desktop application was created as an internal tool by 42 Paris staff for 42 Silicon Valley staff and students to keep track of vehicles in the parking areas, and which vehicles are authorized to park there. It had an outdated backend with old data and a very sparse frontend design, both of which I was asked to update. I don't consider myself a designer but I very much enjoyed developing some fun css animations to go with the theme of a viking god for which the program was named, Heimdall.

This version has had it's authentication and database information removed and disconnected for demo purposes. It is a simple example of the process a user would experience registering their car(s) in the updated site after login.

### Original GUI:

### Updated GUI:

### Built With

* [HTML5](https://html.com/html5/) / [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://expressjs.com/) 
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The official desktop application was not meant for being open-sourced and therefore
is not for use in it's full functionality to be reproduced locally. This is because of the permissions required including:
staff/employee permissions, API scope and other necessary info not accessible to the public. The application's
database, confidential information and files integral to its functioning have therefore been removed. 

To see the demo, please visit: <a href="https://afternoon-ridge-28353.herokuapp.com/">Heimdall Demo</a>
<br /><br /> 
NOTE: If cars are currently created/listed by previous visitors to the site, delete them too see the landing page for when no cars registered for the student for animation.
